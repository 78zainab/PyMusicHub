# PyMusicHub
	In this python based project, I had created a Desktop Music Application in which I had used libraries like tkinter (for GUI), pygame (for playing sounds), mutagen(for handling metadata 
    of audios)
# Skills used in this project:
	->GUI Development with Tkinter – Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for song playback and controls.
    ->Pygame for Audio Processing – Integrated pygame.mixer to load, play, pause, resume, and stop MP3 files.
	->File Handling & Directory Management – Managed file loading, listing, and retrieving metadata from MP3 files.
	->Mutagen Library for Metadata Extraction – Extracted song title, artist, and duration from MP3 files.
	->Event-Driven Programming – Implemented event listeners and callbacks to handle user interactions.
	->Data Structures (Treeview & Lists) – Used ttk.Treeview to display song details in an organized table format.
	->Multithreading Concepts (optional improvement) – Used root.after() to update progress and animations without freezing the UI.
	->Audio Visualization – Created a simple beat visualization using tk.Canvas and random values.
	->Error Handling & Exception Management – Handled user errors such as missing song selection or unavailable files.
	->Volume Control & Mute Functionality – Implemented dynamic volume control using a slider and a mute button.

**#Deliverables for this Project**

	->A Fully Functional Python Music Player
			-Play, pause, resume, next, and previous song controls.
			-Displays song title, artist, and duration dynamically.
			-Shows a progress bar for playback.
			-Implements volume control and mute/unmute features.
			-Provides animated beat visualization.
			-GUI Application with Tkinter
	
	->Interactive UI with buttons, sliders, and tables.
			-Clean and intuitive layout for users.
			-MP3 Metadata Extraction & Management
	
	->Reads song metadata (Title, Artist, Duration) using mutagen.mp3.
			-Populates the playlist dynamically from a folder.
			-Audio Playback & Controls
	
	->Uses pygame.mixer to handle MP3 playback.
			-Implements event-based song selection and playback updates.
	
	->Error Handling & User Feedback
			-Shows message boxes for errors (e.g., missing files, unselected songs).
			-Ensures smooth user experience with proper feedback.
